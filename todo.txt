- Mobile responsiveness (dont forget on hover behaviour of logos)
- Change contact details to a footer?
- Need to open project images to open them and view them in more detail.
- Condense text?
- onmouseover on slideshow pauses but there is no user feeback
- size of slideshow needs adjusting
- fragment navigation bug when navigating from project page to home fragment
- navigation says "Portfolio", heading of section says "Projects"
- outline onFocus on slideshow should be removed
- projects need a sensible ordering (probably newest to oldest)
- Too many words, needs to be more concise
- Move Portfolio section about the about section
- project section could show only 3 rows initially and then a "more" button or something like that
- missing apostrophe in it's .... Whether its short road trips up
- contact section needs better alignment with icon and text
- add linkedin to contact
- Remove "home" link from nav bar. The icon is enough.
- Longer transition times for slideshow.
