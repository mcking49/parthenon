// TODO: Austin's Changes
- Align slideshow properly with the text.
- Slideshow buttons need to always be visible.
- On mouse hover show a dimmed pause overlay.
- See how navigation bar looks when it's only as wide as the text with austin's name next to it in black.


// FIXME: Things for Austin to consider
- Too many words, needs to be more concise
- Condense text?
- Change contact details to a footer?
- missing apostrophe in it's .... Whether its short road trips up

// TODO: Features need to implement
- Create firebase data service
- Count number of button clicks for CV's (track downloads)
.
// TODO: Feature requests (need approval)
- Need to open project images to open them and view them in more detail.
- project section could show only 3 rows initially and then a "more" button or something like that?
- onmouseover on slideshow pauses but there is no user feeback
- Remove "home" link from nav bar. The icon is enough.
- Add titles to tiles.

// FIXME: Bugs: need to research how to fix.
- fragment navigation bug when navigating from project page to home fragment
