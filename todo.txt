// FIXME: Bugs
- Responsive design of portfolio logos
- Add more space between section.
- Replace <hr> with a border-top.

// FIXME: Things for Austin to consider
- Too many words, needs to be more concise
- Condense text?
- Change contact details to a footer?
- missing apostrophe in it's .... Whether its short road trips up

// TODO: Features need to implement
- Install AngularFire and replace firebase methods in service
- Create firebase data service

// TODO: Feature requests (need approval)
- Need to open project images to open them and view them in more detail.
- Projects need a sensible ordering (probably newest to oldest)
- project section could show only 3 rows initially and then a "more" button or something like that?
- onmouseover on slideshow pauses but there is no user feeback
- Remove "home" link from nav bar. The icon is enough.
- Add titles to tiles.

// FIXME: Bugs: need to research how to fix.
- fragment navigation bug when navigating from project page to home fragment
